Currently working at Vimeo as a Principal Engineer. Keeping up to date with WebRTC and occasionally updating my open-source projects (especially the React Native blueprint for JHipster)

I previously worked on SportsBooth, a startup building an ultra-low-latency video platform capable of delivering WebRTC streams from a single source to hundreds of thousands of viewers, with a main focus on sports events and commentary.

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to open a dialogue or collaborate.  You can find me on Twitter at [@jonruddell][] and Github at [@ruddell][]
