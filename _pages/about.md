My name is Jon Ruddell and I am an open-source developer who specializes in WebRTC[] development and the [JHipster][] developer platform.  I also consult independently on the side.

I previously built an ultra-low-latency video platform capable of delivering WebRTC streams from a single source to hundreds of thousands of viewers, with a main focus on sports events and commentary.

I love diving into new technologies and platforms and figuring out how to use them to to meet my needs.  I have experience in a variety of topics including backend (Spring Boot, Java, NodeJS, Python), frontend (JavaScript, Angular, React, React Native, TypeScript, Vue, HTML/CSS), databases (SQL), cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean), and more.

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to open a dialogue or collaborate.  You can find me on Twitter at [@jonruddell][] and Github at [@ruddell][]
