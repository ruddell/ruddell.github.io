My name is Jon Ruddell, my current job is Cofounder/CTO at [SportsBooth][], a startup specializing in real-time video commentary for sports events.  I also occasionally do independent consulting on the side.

I love diving into new technologies and platforms and figuring out how to use them to to meet my needs.  I mainly specialize in [WebRTC][] developement and the [JHipster][] developer platform, and have experience in a variety of languages including Java (Spring and Spring Boot), Javascript (Angular, React, React Native, and Node), C, and C++.

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to open a dialogue or collaborate.  You can find me on Twitter at [@jonruddell][] and Github at [@ruddell][]
